        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sharan Muhhuku, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in User Experience (UX) Design at Wilfrid Laurier University. Based in Canada, I am passionate about creating meaningful and user-friendly digital experiences that make a positive impact on people's lives..</p>
        <p>As a UX Design student, I enjoy exploring the intersection of creativity and functionality. My studies have deepened my understanding of how design influences user behavior, and I’m constantly inspired by the challenge of solving real-world problems through innovative and accessible solutions.</p>
        <p>When I’m not immersed in design projects, I love exploring new ideas, connecting with others, and learning about emerging trends in technology and design. I’m always eager to grow my skills and collaborate with like-minded individuals who share a passion for improving the way we interact with the digital world.</p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out or connect—I’d love to share ideas!</p>
